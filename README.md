# Flight Price Prediction
## Overview: 
This project is all about Flight Price Prediction. Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities like: Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Cochin, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata. In this project we will take some inputs from users like: Departure Date & Time, Arrival Date & Time, Source, Destination, Stoppage and Which Airline you want to travel? Etc. This project is a Supervised Machine Learning project. In this project we have used Multiple Linear Regression because here is Price is a dependent feature and others are independent features like: Departure Date & Time, Arrival Date & Time, Source, Destination, Stoppage. In this project we have train the model using RandomForestRegressor, this ML algorithm predict better accuracy. Using RandomForestRegressor model we got 95% Accuracy on train dataset and 79% Accuracy on test dataset.

## Data Source:
For this project we used dataset from kaggle.com. we have uploaded dataset on GitHub.
