# Flight Price Prediction
## Introduction: 
This project is all about Flight Price Prediction. Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities like: Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Cochin, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata. In this project I will take some inputs from users like: Departure Date & Time, Arrival Date & Time, Source, Destination, Stoppage and Which Airline you want to travel? Etc. This project is a Supervised Machine Learning project. In this project I have used Multiple Linear Regression because here is Price is a dependent feature and others are independent features like: Departure Date & Time, Arrival Date & Time, Source, Destination, Stoppage. In this project I have train my model using RandomForestRegressor, this ML algorithm predict better accuracy. Using RandomForestRegressor model I got 95% Accuracy on my train dataset and 79% Accuracy on my test dataset.
